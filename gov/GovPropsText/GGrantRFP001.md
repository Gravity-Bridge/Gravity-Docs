##  Proposal for Gravity Grants RFP No. 1 (Gravity Bridge GUI/Front end)

The Gravity Bridge community proposes to allocate 290,000 Gravitons towards a UI enhancement, specifically an independent front end with the feature set laid out in the signaling proposal from March 10, 2022 (Signaling proposal for first Gravity Grant RFP - additional GUI/front end).

## Overview

The objective of the GUI Gravity Grant is to build and maintain an independent front end to integrate with the Gravity Bridge. Grant recipients will partner together with the Gravity Bridge team to iterate on UX and integrate with new EVM chains and Cosmos Blockchains. For example, additional ERC-20 or Cosmos tokens could be suggested, as well as changes to the UI or UX flow.

The proposed front end interface should be able to perform the following functions:

- A menu displaying ERC-20 tokens and Ethereum, from which the user can select the token they wish to send
- Integration of Keplr wallet and MetaMask for signing Cosmos and Ethereum transactions
-   Option to send selected ERC-20 tokens to Gravity Bridge or another Cosmos chain
-   Withdraw EVM tokens/Ethereum from Gravity Bridge/Cosmos back to their native state on Ethereum, and provide the user the option to choose between speed and cost (Low fees: send as a batched transaction, to be processed once a batch is filled -- Medium fees: Transaction observes gas fee fluctuations over a period of time (typically 1-3 hours) until median fee is sufficient for a relayer to profitably process the batch -- High fees: Instant transaction)
-   Optional: ability to connect with additional wallets
-   Preferred: Open source code

Communication with the Gravity Bridge team and the Gravity Community are essential steps throughout the completion of this grant. Grant recipients will be expected to create a communication interface between teams and develop a methodology to transparently convey those updates to the community.

## Proposed Grant Amount 

290K GRAV in total, 250K GRAV to be awarded in four installments. 25% awarded upon receipt of grant; 25% awarded upon awarded upon completion of user selectable menu displaying ERC20 ETH tokens + Metamask / Keplr integration, 25% awarded upon completion of option to send ERC 20 Gravity or IBC to other cosmos chains + withdraw back across bridge to ETH with fee selection. 25% awarded upon final review and verdict that all milestones and functionalities are completed and functioning. 40k GRAV paid to MKT Team, who are responsible for administration of the grant process.

Project completion will be determined by Gravity Grants working groups and members of the core Gravity contributors. Gravity multi-sig holders will disburse funds. If the awardee disagrees with the MKT team* or Gravity working group’s decision, a governance vote can be held to overrule the decision.

The GUI Gravity Grant is a one-time grant with no automatic renewal. However, the applicant can apply for further funds to maintain or improve the front end as a separate governance proposal.

## Who could apply?

The GUI Gravity Grant is open to teams or individuals. Grants will be disbursed as GRAV, so applicants must supply a single valid GRAV address.
