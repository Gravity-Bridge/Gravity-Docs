# Gravity Bridge Genesis Validator Setup

## System setup

While Gravity Bridge full nodes can be run on any platform it is recommended you run your validator on Linux. The most up to date version of any particular distribution is recommended.

You can see [validator system setup](validator-system-setup.md) for more setup instructions. But the only part that's important for creating your gentx is that if you have an existing `.gravity` folder in your home directory.
Delete it

### Download the Gravity bridge binary

If you already have a .gravity folder from a previous run of `gravity init` delete it before this step.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/releases/download/v1.0.4/gravity-linux-amd64
chmod +x gravity-linux-amd64
mv gravity-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/gravity
gravity init <your moniker here>
```

### Add your validator key

First we need to import the validator key. This is the key for the address you submitted on the forum.

```bash
gravity keys add <my validator key name> --recover <your seed phrase>
```

Or if your key is stored in a ledger device.

```bash
gravity keys add <my validator key name> --ledger
```

### Generate your Delegate keys

There are three keys involved in this process. The key holding your validator funds, this is the address you submitted for Genesis. Then there are
two 'delegate keys' these are keys that will be used by Gravity Bridge for signing and submissions. If you lose your delegate keys you will have to
unbond and create a new validator because it's not possible to rotate them. So store all output of the following commands in a safe place.

```bash
gravity eth_keys add
gravity keys add <your orchestrator key name>
```

### Create a GenTX

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravity-bridge/gravity-docs/main/genesis.json
mv genesis.json ~/.gravity/config/genesis.json
gravity gentx --moniker <your moniker> <my validator key name> 182000000000ugraviton <orchestrator eth address> <orchestrator address> --chain-id=gravity-bridge-test4
```

### Submit your gentx

In order to submit your gentx open up a pull request to this repo placing your gentx into the 'gentxs' folder
our automated test will check it for validity and after that it will be merged.
