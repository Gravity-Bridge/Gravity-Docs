# Gravity bridge Polaris

As outlined in this [governance proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge/proposals/58)

Gravity Bridge will be upgrading to Polaris

* Ethereum key support - Sign all your Gravity Bridge Chain transactions using your Ethereum key

* Cosmos SDK upgrade to v0.45.6

* IBC upgrade to v3.1.0 (Interchain Accounts to come in a later upgrade)

This upgrade *will not* change the chain-id and will occur at block height `2860730`

## Preparing for the upgrade

Since an upgrade proposal has passed no prep is required. Your node will automatically halt at the correct height.

This upgrade *may* perform store migrations, it contains upgrade logic recommended for migrating ibc-go [here](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/docs/migrations/v2-to-v3.md) and [here](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/docs/migrations/support-denoms-with-slashes.md). Note that Interchain Accounts has not been activated, and therefore the full set of instructions in the first migration document will be followed when enabling Interchain Accounts in a future upgrade.

It is still *recommended* that you prepare enough disk space for a full backup of your node disk state. Or use a compact snapshot generated via [state sync](https://ping.pub/gravity-bridge/statesync) this will help you upgrade faster.

It is ***required*** that you backup your `priv_validator_state.json`. If you do a full backup it will be included, but if you don't have the space backup at least this small file from `.gravity/data/priv_validator_state.json`. It will allow you to manually reconstruct a 'backup' from a snapshot and this file if required.

You may wish to research BTRFS and ZFS for your validator, as they will allow instant snapshots and backups that require no additional space on your disk.

## Backup your node

If your node has not yet halted at block `2860730` you are too early! Please wait.

Once the chain has reached block height `2860730` run `service gravity-bridge-stop`

**Once your node has halted it is recommended you backup your chain state**.

Make a complete copy of your `$HOME/.gravity` folder. Exactly how you make this copy is up to you and depending on your system setup some methods may be dramatically faster than others.

If you are using a copy-on-write filesystem like BTRFS or ZFS a simple copy will be the fastest possible backup method.

```bash
cp -r --reflink=always ~/.gravity gravity-bridge-polaris-backup/
```

If you have `pigz` available for parallel gzip compression you can use

```bash
tar --use-compress-program=pigz -cvf gravity-bridge-polaris-backup.tar.gz ~/.gravity
```

If you have LVM snapshots available you may use them as well.

Finally if none of these quick backup options are available to you you should follow [these instructions](https://ping.pub/gravity-bridge/statesync) to statesync your node, dramatically reducing the size of the Gravity folder in exchange for not having historical block data.

Once you have state synced you can quickly and easily backup with just the cp command.

```bash
cp -r ~/.gravity gravity-bridge-polaris-backup/
```

If you do not have sufficient disk space to backup your entire gravity folder then backup your `priv_validator_state.json`

```bash
cp ~/.gravity/data/priv_validator_state.json validator-state-backup.json
```

If all goes well you will not need either of these. If the upgrade fails we will roll back to this backup state and try to run it again, if you don't have a backup you will be unable to roll back, or worse you may double sign.

## Upgrading node software

```bash
mkdir gravity-bin
cd gravity-bin

# the gravity chain binary itself

wget https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/releases/download/v1.6.5/gravity-linux-amd64
mv gravity-linux-amd64 gravity

# Tools for the gravity bridge from the gravity repo

wget https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/releases/download/v1.6.5/gbt
chmod +x *
sudo mv * /usr/bin/
```

### If you are validating on Mac, Windows, or Linux ARM

If you are validating on any of these platforms you will need to build your own binary.

```
git clone https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge
cd Gravity-Bridge/module
make install
cp $GOPATH/bin/gravity /usr/bin/gravity
```

## **WARNING**

Run `service orchestrator status` after the upgrade, if you are experiencing this issue the big red error messages will be obvious. If your orchestrator is not running correclty you may be slashed in about 10,000 blocks. So be sure to check

## Restart the chain

```bash
service gravity-node start
service orchestrator restart
```

Your node will be slow to start as it performs the migrations, after that we will wait for all the other validators to join for the chain to resume.

## Expected Upgrade Logs

Shortly after upgrading you should see some log output like the following when the Polaris upgrade runs:

```text
