This document contains a list of block explorers and frontend interfaces for use with Gravity

## Bridge frontends

- [Blockscape](https://bridge.blockscape.network/#/)
- [Spacestation](https://spacestation.zone/)

## Governance Forum

Governance proposals should be coordinated using the [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/gravity-bridge) forum.

## Blockexplorer

- [Mintscan Explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge)
- [Aneka Explorer](https://gravity.aneka.io/)
- [Skynet Explorer](https://www.skynetexplorers.com/gravity-bridge)
- [Atomscan Explorer](https://atomscan.com/gravity-bridge)

## Gravity.sol Contract Address

The Gravity Bridge Blockchain contract address is.

[0xa4108aA1Ec4967F8b52220a4f7e94A8201F2D906](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa4108aA1Ec4967F8b52220a4f7e94A8201F2D906)

The Gravity Bridge contract ABI is available as `Gravity.json` attached to every [release](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/releases/download/v1.5.2/Gravity.json)

## RPC

provides ABCI on `26657` Legacy RPC on port `1317` and gRPC on port `9090`

```

## Testnet

The Gravity Bridge testnet is simply a copy of the [local developer environment](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/blob/main/docs/developer/environment-setup.md) exposed to the outside world.

This environment is made up of two chains, one Gravity chain and another IBC test chain.

Testnet RPC

http://testnet.gravitychain.io:27657 # ABCI IBC network
http://testnet.gravitychain.io:9190  # GRPC IBC network

http://testnet.gravitychain.io:8545  # Ethereum

Keys containing test tokens

These is the private keys for the validators on the testnet

This is the private key for the Ethereum miner, it has access to ETH and several ERC20's pre-deployed
