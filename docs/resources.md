This document contains a list of block explorers and frontend interfaces for use with Gravity

## Bridge frontends

- [Blockscape](https://bridge.blockscape.network/#/)
- [Spacestation](https://spacestation.zone/)

## Governance Forum

Governance proposals should be coordinated using the [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/gravity-bridge) forum.

## Blockexplorer

- [Mintscan Explorer](https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge)
- [Aneka Explorer](https://gravity.aneka.io/)
- [Skynet Explorer](https://www.skynetexplorers.com/gravity-bridge)

## Gravity.sol Contract Address

The Gravity Bridge Blockchain contract address is.

[0xa4108aA1Ec4967F8b52220a4f7e94A8201F2D906](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa4108aA1Ec4967F8b52220a4f7e94A8201F2D906)

The Gravity Bridge contract ABI is available as `Gravity.json` attached to every [release](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/releases/download/v1.5.2/Gravity.json)

## RPC

provides ABCI on `26657` Legacy RPC on port `1317` and gRPC on port `9090`

## Testnet

The Gravity Bridge testnet is simply a copy of the [local developer environment](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/blob/main/docs/developer/environment-setup.md) exposed to the outside world.

This environment is made up of two chains, one Gravity chain and another IBC test chain.

Testnet RPC

ERC20 tokens to test with, the miner private key has access
Also note that this testnet instance is using Hardhat, and thus has actual historical Ethereum state to interact with. It is possible to acquire some ETH from the Ethereum miner (see private key above) and swap for many ERC20s on Uniswap.
